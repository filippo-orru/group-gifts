Group gifts makes Christmas in a large friend group stress-free! 

It works like this:

1. Create a group and invite all your friends or family members
2. Write your wishlist and set your budget for everyone
3. Chat about other people's wishes
4. Everyone only buys gifts for the person they were assigned to
